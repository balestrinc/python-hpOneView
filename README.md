HPE OneView SDK for Python
===========================

This library provides a pure Python interface to the HPE OneView REST APIs.

HPE OneView is a fresh approach to converged infrastructure management, inspired
by the way you expect to work, with a single integrated view of your IT
infrastructure.

The HPE OneView Python library depends on the
[Python-Future](http://python-future.org/index.htm)  library to provide Python
2/3 compatibility.  This will be installed automatically if you use the installation
methods described below.

Installation
------------

### From source

Either:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-hpOneView.git
$ cd python-hpOneView
$ python setup.py install --user  # to install in the user directory (~/.local)
$ sudo python setup.py install    # to install globally
```

Or if using PIP:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-hpOneView.git
$ cd python-hpOneView
$ pip install .
```

Both of these installation methods work if you are using virtualenv, which you should be!

### From Pypi

Coming soon


API Implementation
------------------

Status listing of the HPE OneView REST interfaces that have been implemented in the Python library so far is hosted in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-hpOneView/wiki/API-Implementation) 


Logging
-------

This module uses Pythonâ€™s Standard Library logging module. An example of how to configure logging was provided on ```/examples/logger.py ```.
To see more configuration options, look at [configuring logging](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#configuring-logging)
